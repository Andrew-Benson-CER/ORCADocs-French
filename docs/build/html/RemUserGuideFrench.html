<div class="line">The Online Event Reporting System (OERS) was created to allow
companies to report events</div>
<div class="line">directly to the Canada Energy Regulator (CER). In this manual you will
find instructions on how to use OERS to report environmental
contamination through a Notice of Contamination (NOC), submit
documentation such as a remedial action plan (RAP), closure report and
annual update and communicate with the CER environmental analyst
assigned to the remediation (REM) event.</div>
</div>
<p>For information on other types of events required to be reported and for
additional guidance on those event types (e.g., Incident reporting),
please see the <em>Canada Energy Regulator Event Reporting Guidelines</em>

<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">The site status needs to be updated annually. The below guidance
should be used when assigning site statuses to REM events:</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="_images/image33.png"><img alt="cid:image002.png&#64;01D67560.E67250D0" src="_images/image33.png" style="width: 3.42847in; height: 1.40625in;" /></a></p>
<p>Site assessment – Environmental Site Assessment in progress to
determine next steps, prior to active remedial or risk management
work</p>
<p>Ongoing remediation – RAP has been submitted and/or or active
remedial work is ongoing</p>
<p>Post remediation monitoring – Active remedial work complete and
groundwater or reclamation monitoring is in effect</p>
<p>Risk managed – Risk Management Plan has been submitted and/or risk
management is taking place</p>
<p>Facility monitoring – Use this status at facilities on company owned

place as described in section 12.3 of the CER 2020 Remediation
Process Guide.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Items that should be included in the summary of planned future
remedial activities and submitted reports are as follows: the plans
for the development of a remedial action plan (RAP), risk management
plan (RMP) or closure report in the annual update), along with
justification for the report being developed. The CER Environmental
Analyst will consider this justification, along with the information
submitted in the NOC, CCME worksheets, and any persons’ interest(s)

<div class="section" id="site-closure">
<h2>5.10 Site Closure<a class="headerlink" href="#site-closure" title="Lien permanent vers ce titre">¶</a></h2>
<p>Site Closure is initiated by CER staff by requesting a “Closure Report”
through an email generated by the system. The workflow for this request
will be similar to other report types. The company contact may request a
deadline extension, view the report status, and upload a document
pertaining to the Closure Report under the Remediation Reports tab.</p>
<p><a href="#id74"><span class="problematic" id="id75">|C:\\Users\\eventess\\Pictures\\Picture24.png|</span></a></p>
<p>Upon submission of a Closure Report and Declaration Letter, the CER
environmental analyst will review the closure report and if satisfied,
recommend site closure to the Director of the Environmental Protection
Team. Upon accepting the recommendation to close the site, the CER will
send via email a Remediation Closure Letter and Close the REM event in
OERS. The company will receive an automated email stating that the REM
event has been closed and will no longer be able to access the REM event
in OERS.</p>
